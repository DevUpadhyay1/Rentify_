Q1. Define a network and explain its importance in real-world systems. [5 Marks]

Definition:
A network is a structure that represents a set of entities (called nodes or vertices) and the relationships or connections (called edges or links) among them.
It is usually represented mathematically as G = (V, E), where

V → set of nodes (entities),

E → set of edges (relationships).

Explanation:
Networks help us model and analyze complex relationships between objects — whether people, computers, cities, or biological systems. By studying the patterns of connections, we can understand how information, influence, or resources flow in the system.

Importance in real-world systems:

Social Media: Understanding how users interact on platforms like Facebook or Twitter.

Computer Networks: Representing data transfer between servers, routers, and clients.

Transportation Systems: Modeling roads, flights, or railway connections between cities.

Biological Networks: Understanding protein interactions or neural connections.

Business and Economics: Analyzing trade networks or supply chain dependencies.

In short:
Networks are vital because they help us visualize, measure, and optimize relationships in almost every domain of life and technology.

Q2. Differentiate between a graph and a network with suitable examples. [5 Marks]
Aspect	Graph	Network
Definition	A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of nodes connected by edges.	A network is a graph with additional meaning — nodes and edges represent real-world entities and relationships.
Focus	Abstract mathematical relationships.	Real-world interpretation and data associated with connections.
Components	Only vertices and edges.	Vertices, edges, and often weights, directions, or attributes.
Example 1	A graph of 5 nodes connected randomly.	A social network where people (nodes) are connected by friendships (edges).
Example 2	A simple undirected graph showing node connections.	A transportation network where cities (nodes) are connected by roads with distances (weighted edges).

Summary:
Every network is a graph, but not every graph is a network.
Graphs provide the mathematical foundation, while networks give real-world meaning to those graphs.

Q3. Explain the major components of a network: nodes and edges. [5 Marks]

1. Nodes (Vertices):

Nodes are the basic entities or points in a network.

Each node represents an actor or object, such as a person, organization, city, or computer.

In social media, a node may represent a user; in a road network, a city; in biology, a gene or protein.

Nodes can have attributes, like name, age, location, or type.

2. Edges (Links):

Edges are the connections or relationships between nodes.

They show how nodes interact or are related.

Edges can be:

Directed: A → B (e.g., one user follows another on Twitter).

Undirected: A ↔ B (e.g., mutual friendship on Facebook).

They may also have weights to represent strength, distance, or frequency of interaction.

Example:
In a friendship network:

Each person = node.

Friendship between two people = edge.

If person A is friends with person B → edge (A, B).

Diagram (conceptually):

[A] ---- [B] ---- [C]


Here, A, B, and C are nodes, and the lines between them are edges.

Q4. Explain how centrality measures help in understanding real-world networks. [5 Marks]

Answer:
Centrality measures help identify important or influential nodes in a network based on their position and connections. They provide insights into power, communication flow, and influence within real-world systems.

Types and Uses:

Degree Centrality: Identifies active or popular nodes (e.g., most followed user on Twitter).

Closeness Centrality: Finds nodes that can quickly reach others (useful in communication networks).

Betweenness Centrality: Detects nodes acting as bridges between communities (e.g., brokers).

Eigenvector/PageRank Centrality: Finds influential nodes connected to other important nodes (e.g., top websites).

In short:
Centrality helps locate key influencers, information spreaders, or connectors in networks like social media, business, and communication systems.

Q5. Describe how network measures can be used in social network analysis. [5 Marks]

Answer:
Network measures quantify structural properties of a social network and reveal how individuals interact.

Key Measures:

Degree: Measures activity or popularity of a person.

Closeness: Indicates how quickly a person can reach others.

Betweenness: Highlights people bridging different groups.

Density: Shows how closely knit the network is.

Clustering Coefficient: Reflects tendency of people’s friends to also be friends.

Use:
These measures help understand influence, information flow, community strength, and network cohesion in real-world social systems like Facebook, LinkedIn, or company teams.

Q6. What is clustering coefficient? Explain its role in network structure analysis. [5 Marks]

Answer:
The clustering coefficient measures the degree to which nodes in a network tend to cluster together — i.e., how likely a node’s neighbors are also connected to each other.

Formula:

𝐶
(
𝑣
)
=
2
𝐸
𝑣
𝑘
𝑣

)
C(v)=

(k

	​


where 
𝐸
𝑣
E
v
	​

 = number of links among neighbors of node v,

𝑘
𝑣

	​

 = degree of node v.

Role in Structure Analysis:

High clustering → tightly connected communities (social networks).

Low clustering → sparse or random connections (technological networks).
It helps in identifying local group formation, community structure, and social cohesion.

Example:
In a friend group where everyone knows everyone else → high clustering coefficient.

Q7. Differentiate between small-world and scale-free networks. [5 Marks]
Feature	Small-World Network	Scale-Free Network
Definition	Networks with high clustering and short average path lengths.	Networks where few nodes (hubs) have many connections while most have few.
Degree Distribution	Approximately uniform.	Follows power-law distribution.
Examples	Watts–Strogatz model, social networks.	Internet, citation networks, airline routes.
Characteristics	"Six degrees of separation" effect (everyone connected through few steps).	Presence of influential hubs.
Applications	Modeling social and biological systems.	Modeling web links and communication systems.

Summary:
Small-world = local clusters + short paths.
Scale-free = few super-connected hubs dominating the network.

Q8. Discuss the impact of randomness and preferential attachment in network formation. [5 Marks]

Answer:
Networks grow based on how new nodes attach to existing ones. Two main mechanisms are:

Randomness:

Nodes connect randomly.

Leads to Erdős–Rényi random networks.

Produces uniform degree distribution and low clustering.

Example: Randomly connecting computers.

Preferential Attachment:

New nodes prefer to connect to already well-connected nodes (“rich get richer”).

Produces scale-free networks with hubs.

High clustering and small path length.

Example: Popular websites attract more links.

Impact:
Randomness → uniform, less structured networks.
Preferential attachment → hierarchical, hub-dominated structures as seen in real-world systems.

Q9. Describe the main assumptions of random and preferential attachment models. [5 Marks]
Aspect	Random Network Model (Erdős–Rényi)	Preferential Attachment Model (Barabási–Albert)
Connection Rule	Edges are added randomly between nodes.	New nodes connect preferentially to high-degree nodes.
Assumptions	1. Each pair of nodes has equal chance to connect.
2. No preference or hierarchy.	1. Network grows over time.
2. Probability of connecting depends on degree (popularity).
Degree Distribution	Binomial/Poisson.	Power-law (few hubs, many small nodes).
Clustering	Low.	High.
Example	Random friendships.	Social media following (celebrities get more followers).

In short:
Random model → equal chance connections.
Preferential model → popularity-based connections.

Q10. Explain the working principle of the PageRank algorithm. [5 Marks]

Answer:
PageRank evaluates the importance of a node based on the number and quality of incoming links.
It was originally used by Google to rank webpages.

Working Principle:

Each page starts with equal rank.

A page’s importance increases when important pages link to it.

Rank is divided equally among outgoing links.

The process repeats until ranks stabilize (convergence).

Formula:

𝑃

.

Example:

Q11. Compare the PageRank and HITS algorithms. [5 Marks]
Aspect	PageRank	HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search)
Invented by	Larry Page & Sergey Brin (Google).	Jon Kleinberg (IBM Research).
Idea	A page is important if it is linked by other important pages.	A page can be a good hub or a good authority.
Scores Given	One score (PageRank value).	Two scores: Hub and Authority.
Computation	Based on probability of random surfer visiting a page.	Based on mutual reinforcement between hubs and authorities.
Use Case	Global importance ranking (web search).	Topic-specific ranking (query-based).
Example	Google’s search ranking.	Identifying top topic pages and directories.

Summary:

PageRank → Global measure of importance.

HITS → Topic-based hub and authority identification.
